# Hello-World
This is an introductory repository directed from GitHub's guides
A little about myself- I'm an avid fighting game player (hence the FGC in my handle), as well as enjoyment deriving from video games in general.
Even if I'm not great, I love learning about cooking and replicating it in the kitchen.
Books are awesome!
Originally went to school for IT work, decided it wasn't for me and am on a self-driven path to learn python.
